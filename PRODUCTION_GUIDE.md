# 🚀 Production Improvements

To make this system ready for production use, consider the following improvements:

---

## ⚙️ Celery / Worker Setup

* ✅ **Use a process manager (e.g., supervisord) for Celery**

  * Helps in monitoring and restarting workers.

* ✅ **Use separate queues**

  * Separate CPU-heavy tasks (e.g., PDF parsing) from lightweight ones.

---

## 📄 File Storage

* ✅ **Use persistent storage or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3)**

  * Avoid data loss if containers restart.

* ✅ **Use CDN**

  * Serve processed or uploaded files efficiently to end-users.

---

## 🧵 Async / Parallelism

* ✅ **Tune Celery concurrency**

  * Use `--concurrency` flag based on available CPU cores.

* ✅ **Tune PostgreSQL connection pool**

  * Use a pooler like `pgbouncer` for better performance under load.

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Logging

* ✅ **Error Monitoring**

  * Integrate tools like Sentry for exception tracking.

* ✅ **Centralized Logging**

  * Use ELK stack, Loki, or AWS CloudWatch to aggregate logs from containers.

---

## 🐳 Docker & Environment

* ✅ **Use `env_file` instead of inline secrets**

  * Keeps secrets out of source control and makes configuration cleaner.

* ✅ **Separate Docker setups for dev/staging/prod**

  * Helps isolate changes and avoid accidental leaks.

* ✅ **Configure health checks**

  * For Redis, Postgres, and Celery containers.

---

## 📂 Database

* ✅ **Add indexes**

  * On frequently queried fields like `Job.status`, `OcrResult.job_id`.

* ✅ **Clean up old data**

  * Use periodic tasks to delete or archive outdated jobs/results.

---

## 📊 Performance

* ✅ **Batch PDF processing**

  * Load pages lazily or in parallel using PyMuPDF/multiprocessing.

* ✅ **Optimize outlier detection**

  * Profile with large documents and improve logic if needed.

---

Implementing these steps will significantly harden and scale your system for real-world usage.
